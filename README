             Example project plus dependencies

    ~ What is this?

      This repository contains a script that builds a tarball
      of Flask, Werkzeug and Jinja2 together with an example
      project that shows how Flask can be used.

    ~ Why?

      Because the longer it takes people to dive into a project
      the less likely it will be that they even try.  Some other
      frameworks lower the barrier a lot by providing just a
      single file to download and get started.

    ~ What do I need?

      OS X, Linux or Windows with an installed Python interpreter.
      The files here are ment for developers of the script only,
      Flask and the Kitchensink can be downloaded from the Flask
      website.
